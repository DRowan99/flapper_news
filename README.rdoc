A project to demonstrate how to create a web application implementing an AngularJS frontend with a RESTful Rails API on the backend.  Bootstrap is also implemented for styling.

The end-result website is a clone of a [reddit][reddit-url] or [Hacker News][hacker-news-url] style upvote site.

This project is from a [free thinkster tutorial][thinkster-url] - thanks [thinkster.io][thinkster-url]!
